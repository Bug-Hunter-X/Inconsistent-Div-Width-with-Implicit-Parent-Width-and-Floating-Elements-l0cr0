The following CSS code fixes the bug by explicitly setting the width of the parent container:

```css
.parent {
  width: 100%; /* or a specific pixel width */
}
div {
  width: 50%;
  float: left;
}
```

By setting the parent's width to 100% of its containing element, or to a specific pixel value, we remove the ambiguity and ensure that the divs correctly occupy 50% of the parent's width consistently across all browsers.
